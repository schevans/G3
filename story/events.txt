FIRST_HOSTILE = "Ahh. This system is $BADDIE. We could mine any unoccupied planets and sneak away. Or we could fight. I wouldn't recomend that, though - remember I die: You die. Oddly, the reverse is not the case so should you ever feel the need to step out of the airlock, I could get home safely. But anyway, best upgrade me a bit before you try and take a pop at anyone."

FIRST_NEUTRAL = "Ok, these guys are $NEUTRALS. We can trade with them but beyond that they aren't interested in helping. They've got great tech, tho, so don't pick a fight unless you'd like us to get smoked. If you weant to trade, get close and initiate docking ($DOCKING)."

FIRST_FRIENDLY = "Aha! These guys - the $FRIENDLYS - should be on our side. They're still figting the $BADDIEs, and they may be able to help us. Get close and dock ($DOCKING), they may even join us! Be nice to have company. I mean, you meat-bags are ok, but you guys are sooooooooo slooooowwwww. I'd like another ship to chat with, you know - space-gossip."

# NOTE: On planet/discovery
FIRST_SISTERS = "Oh, that's interesting - that's a Sister's Station. They're some quazi-religous-space-nun-thing. They have their own agenda, but we should be safe docking here. We can buy weapons, repair my armor and maybe pick up some crew. Be nice to have someone else to talk to."
